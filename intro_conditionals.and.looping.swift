    rather than multiple 'if' statements it may be easier to use switch/case
    in this example, see if value of temp is between 0 and 15, then output accordingly.

    NOTE: The list has to be 'exhaustive' meaning all eventualities must be covered.
    Easiest way to achieve this is with a 'default' at the end, a catch-all condition.
