# Playgrounds

A great starting point for learning Swift 2 (and Xcode generally) is to make a Playground.
A playground is just an instant coding sandbox, where the code you write is immediately evaluated and the results shown instantly
The only thing it lacks currently is user input, it's basically to test your code, algorithms and ideas.

I'll be posting mine here, you could copy and paste code into your own playground, but that really isn't the best way to learn.
I highly recommend reading the comments in the code and thinking about the ideas, then experimenting in your own Playground. Remember that Swift 2 is now open-source so if you don't have a Mac you can practice your coding on pretty much ANY device by using things like IBM's Swift Sandbox. (Even works in an iPad, if you're mad enough to type code on that keyboard!)

Enjoy the playgrounds!
